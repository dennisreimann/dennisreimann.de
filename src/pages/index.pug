      # Would you like to increase your products velocity and time to market?

      Fast iteration is key to ensure you are solving the right problems.
      You and your team are facing lots of challenges building an innovative product:
      - How to establish a cohesive experience that fulfills your customers needs?
      - How to ensure design and development communicate and work efficiently?
      - Moving quickly, how do you maintain quality, consistency and reliability?
      - And most meaningfully to you: how to sustain velocity doing all of that?

      Your goal is faster time to market and increased product value.
      Your team is eager, but struggling to deliver high quality with the required pace?

      ## Enter UI engineering and design systems

      A modular UI toolkit that is easily accessible enables shorter iteration cycles.
      <mark>A solid design system and component library speed up your releases without compromising quality.</mark>
      Using these tools and techniques you willâ€¦
      - Deliver a consistent experience across all your products touchpoints
      - Create a streamlined process that reduces design and engineering time
      - Give designers and engineers the freedom to work on higher-order tasks
      - Raise the overall quality of your product and its many interfaces

      In brief: Waste less resources and money while your team can tackle the challenges that matter to your customers.

      ## How can I help?

      As a User Interface Engineer I help product teams to build applications based on a solid design system and component library.
      With an interdisciplinary skillset of development and design I assist in architecting, integrating and deploying complex systems;
      taking into account the multitude of concerns like user experience, performance and future maintenance.

      The benefits have various facets:
      In the domain of e-commerce a consistent and coherent experience translates to customers trust.
      SaaS teams improve the clarity of their product, which leads to efficiency for the end user.
      Better performance increases the conversion rates and delights your users.
      Your whole team speaks a common language and has tighter communication loops.

      I enjoy tackling ambitious goals as part of an interdisciplinary product team.
      Also, I like to help people improving their skills and efficiency.
